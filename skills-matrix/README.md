## Possible form collection
I think that grading skill level, either by self assessment and/or by peer review, is problematic. Binary questions are better:
* Do you have any x skills: yes/no
* Do you feel confident applying skill x to a client project: yes/no
* Is it a priority for you to increase your x skills: yes/no
* Do you feel confident to teach/coach skill x to others: yes/no
