  <form>
    <label for="filter">Filter by: </label>
    <select id="filter">
      <option value="all" selected>All</option>
      <option value="project">Project skilled</option>
      <option value="student">Students</option>
      <option value="teacher">Teachers</option>
    </select>

  <div class="all"></div>
  <p>The above prototype is based on a set of assumed user stories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As a resourcer, I want to know what skills we are short of so that I can recruit new people who have those skills</li>
    <li>As a resourcer, I want to know what skills we are short of, and who wants to increase a certain skill, so that I can organise appropriate training</li>
    <li>As a resourcer I wan to know who is available to coach/teach others a certain skill</li>
    <li>As a delivery manager, I want to know who has a skill, at a level that can deliver a project, so that I can select the right people for the project</li>
    <li>As a resourcer/delivery manager, I want to know who wants to increase a certain skill, so that they can be paired with more skilled people on projects</li>
    <li>As a developer, I want to know what skills are strategically important to the company, and where there are deficiencies, so that I may develop my skills in areas where there is a shortage</li>
    <li>As a developer, I want to know who else is learning a skill so that I might get in touch and share knowledge.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hover over the data points to see who has the skill. The legend indicates how developed/developing their skill level is. They may also be filtered with the select list. The data points are generated from a simple, but hopefully versatile, data object:</p>
<pre>
{
  "name": "Charlie Bloggs",
  "category": "Back end",
  "skill": "Drupal",
  "project": true,
  "student": false,
  "teacher": false
}
</pre>
  <p>Data capture would be handled by a separate application. I think that grading skill level, either by self assessment and/or by peer review, is problematic. Binary questions are better:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you have any x skills: yes/no</li>
    <li>Do you feel confident applying skill x to a client project: yes/no</li>
    <li>Is it a priority for you to increase your x skills: yes/no</li>
    <li>Do you feel confident to teach/coach skill x to others: yes/no</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, if you feel confident that you could be part of a team that delivers a client project built mainly with Vue.js, then you should register Vue.js as a project skill. If you are not yet at this level, but can build applications with Vue.js, you should register it as a skill. If you are currently studying Vue.js, mark yourself as a student. If you feel you can, and want to,  teach Vue.js to others, then mark yourself as a teacher.</p>
  <h3>Some considerations...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How are we define a skill? Just <em>code</em> skills?</li>
    <li>How granular can/should we get with identifying skills? For example: <em>Back end > PHP > Drupal > Drupal 8 > Block plugins</em>?</li>
    <li>Data privacy: skills you don't have, or have not developed yet, could be considered sensitive information.</li>
    <li>This does not identify project availability.</li>
    <li>Add more views, like a personal view? For example:</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="personal"></div>
  <h2>Robot assessed</h2>
