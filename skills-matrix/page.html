  <p>The above prototype is based on a set of assumed user stories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As a resourcer, I want to know what skills we are short of so that I can recruit new people who have those skills</li>
    <li>As a resourcer, I want to know what skills we are short of, and who wants to increase a certain skill, so that I can organise appropriate training</li>
    <li>As a resourcer I wan to know who is available to coach/teach others a certain skill</li>
    <li>As a delivery manager, I want to know who has a skill, at a level that can deliver a project, so that I can select the right people for the project</li>
    <li>As a resourcer/delivery manager, I want to know who wants to increase a certain skill, so that they can be paired with more skilled people on projects</li>
    <li>As a developer, I want to know what skills are strategically important to the company, and where there are deficiencies, so that I may develop my skills in areas where there is a shortage</li>
    <li>As a developer, I want to know who else is learning a skill so that I might get in touch and share knowledge.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hover over the data points to see who has the skill. The key indicates how developed/developing their skill level is. They may also be filtered. The data points are generated from a simple, but hopefully versatile, data object:</p>
  <p>Data capture would be handled by a separate application. I think that grading skill level, either by self assessment and/or by peer review, is problematic. Binary questions are better:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you have any x skills: yes/no</li>
    <li>Do you feel confident applying skill x to a client project: yes/no</li>
    <li>Is it a priority for you to increase your x skills: yes/no</li>
    <li>Do you feel confident to teach/coach skill x to others: yes/no</li>
  </ul>
<pre>
{
  "name": "Werner Wunder",
  "category": "Back end",
  "skill": "Drupal",
  "project": true,
  "student": false,
  "teacher": false
}
</pre>
  <p>The mappings for an Elasticsearch index might look something like this:</p>
  <pre>
$mappings = [ 
  'index' => 'skills', 
  'type' => 'default', 
  'body' => [ 
    'properties' => [ 
      'uid' => [ 
        'type' => 'integer', 
      ],
      'category' => [ 
        'type' => 'keyword', 
      ],
      'skill' => [
        'type' => 'keyword',
      ],
      'project' => [ 
        'type' => 'boolean',
      ],
      'student' => [ 
        'type' => 'boolean',
      ],
      'teacher' => [ 
        'type' => 'boolean', 
      ],
     ],
  ],
];
</pre>
  <h3>Some considerations...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How do we define a skill? Just <em>technical</em> skills?</li>
    <li>How granular can/should we get with identifying skills? For example: <em>Back end > Php > Drupal > Drupal 8 > Block plugins</em>?</li>
    <li>Data privacy: skills you don't have, or have not developed yet, could be considered sensitive information, if they are identified to everyone.</li>
    <li>What about availability?</li>
  </ul>
